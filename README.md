WebsphereEmbedded
=================

Projects aimed at testing websphere 8.5 embedded.   

## Requirements
In order to test those projects, [websphere for developer](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/downloads/ws/wasdevelopers/) 
must be installed. A database server of your choice must also be present, here [DB2 Express-C](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/db2/express-c/download.html) is used.
After websphere is installed, the installation path must be configured in test-ejb/pom.xml.
